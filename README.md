# Sophisticated-wolves-API
# This is an API for [Sophisticated Wolves mod](https://github.com/NightKosh/Sophisticated-wolves)

Using this API you can:
- Spawn any type of sophisticated wolves
- Get access to already spawned sophisticated wolves and its properties

I'm highly recommend you to use this API in your project as [git submodule](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Submodules)
